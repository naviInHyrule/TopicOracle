# TopicOracle
This shiny app visualises and compares topics across time variables such as months, day of the week and hours. 

This app uses random fictious data created by RandomDataGenerator.R. To run this app make sure that you set your working directory where the ui.R and server.R files are and then run: runApp(appDir = getwd(),launch.browser = TRUE). Enjoy!
